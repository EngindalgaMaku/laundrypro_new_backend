## System Architecture

### Backend Components

#### 1. Location Service (`lib/services/location-service.ts`)

```typescript
class LocationService {
  // Distance calculation using Haversine formula
  static calculateDistance(point1: Coordinates, point2: Coordinates): number;

  // Route optimization using nearest neighbor algorithm
  static optimizeRoute(
    startPoint: Coordinates,
    destinations: Coordinates[]
  ): Coordinates[];

  // Find nearest locations to a reference point
  static findNearestLocation<T>(
    currentLocation: Coordinates,
    locations: T[]
  ): T;
}
```

#### 2. Order-Route Integration Service (`lib/services/order-route-integration.ts`)

```typescript
class OrderRouteIntegrationService {
  // Get orders ready for route assignment
  static async getOrdersReadyForRoutes(
    businessId: string,
    types: ("pickup" | "delivery")[]
  ): Promise<OrderLocationData[]>;

  // Assign orders to existing route automatically
  static async assignOrdersToRoute(
    routeId: string,
    businessId: string,
    options: RouteOptimizationOptions
  ): Promise<RouteAssignmentResult>;

  // Generate optimal routes automatically
  static async generateOptimalRoutes(
    businessId: string,

## Database Schema

The system utilizes the existing comprehensive database schema with these key tables:

### Core Route Planning Tables

```sql
-- Vehicles with tracking capabilities
Vehicle {
  id, plateNumber, maxWeightKg, maxItemCount
  hasGps, currentKm, assignedDriverId
  latitude?, longitude? -- Current position
}

-- Routes with optimization data
Route {
  id, routeName, routeType, status
  plannedDate, plannedStartTime, plannedEndTime
  totalDistance, estimatedDuration, optimizedFor
  optimizationScore, totalWeight, totalItems
}

-- Route stops with location data
RouteStop {
  id, routeId, sequence, stopType, status
  address, latitude, longitude
  customerId, customerName, customerPhone
  plannedArrival, actualArrival, itemCount, weight
}

-- Real-time vehicle tracking
VehicleTrackingLog {
  id, vehicleId, driverId, routeId
  latitude, longitude, accuracy, heading, speed
  status, timestamp
}

-- Order-stop relationships
RouteStopOrder {
  id, routeStopId, orderId, actionType, sequence
}
```

### Location-Enhanced Tables

```sql
-- Customers with coordinates
Customer {
  id, firstName, lastName, phone, address
  city, district, latitude?, longitude?
}

-- Orders with pickup/delivery addresses
Order {
  id, customerId, status, priority
  pickupAddress?, deliveryAddress?
  pickupDate?, deliveryDate?
}
```

## Usage Examples

### 1. Auto-Generate Routes

```typescript
// API Call
POST /api/route-integration/generate-routes
{
  "targetDate": "2025-01-15",
  "maxStops": 15,
  "prioritizeUrgent": true,
  "vehicleCapacityWeight": 1000,
  "vehicleCapacityItems": 50
}

// Response
{
  "success": true,
  "generatedRoutes": [
    {
      "routeId": "route-123",
      "routeName": "Auto Route - Kadƒ±k√∂y - 2025-01-15",
      "vehicleId": "vehicle-456",
      "stopCount": 12,
      "totalDistance": 45.7,
      "estimatedDuration": 180
    }
  ],
  "unassignedOrders": [],
  "message": "Generated 1 routes with 12 stops"
}
```

### 2. Get Nearby Orders

```typescript
// API Call
GET /api/route-integration/nearby-orders?latitude=41.0082&longitude=28.9784&radius=5

// Response
{
  "success": true,
  "orders": [
    {
      "orderId": "order-789",
      "orderNumber": "ORD-12345",
      "customerName": "Ahmet Yƒ±lmaz",
      "customerPhone": "+905551234567",
      "status": "READY_FOR_DELIVERY",
      "priority": "HIGH",
      "deliveryAddress": "Kadƒ±k√∂y, ƒ∞stanbul",
      "deliveryCoordinates": {
        "latitude": 40.9925,
        "longitude": 29.0249
      },
      "distance": 1.2
    }
  ],
  "count": 1,
  "radiusKm": 5
}
```

### 3. Start Vehicle Tracking (Mobile)

```typescript
// Mobile App
const subscription = await LocationService.startVehicleTracking("vehicle-123", {
  routeId: "route-456",
  driverId: "driver-789",
  updateInterval: 30000, // 30 seconds
  distanceFilter: 100, // 100 meters
});

// Automatically sends location updates to server
```

### 4. Suggest Pickup Route (Mobile)

```typescript
// Mobile App
const suggestedOrders = await LocationService.suggestPickupRoute(
  "vehicle-123",
  currentLocation,
  10 // max stops
);

// Returns orders sorted by distance and priority
```

## Route Optimization Algorithm

### 1. Order Clustering

- Groups orders by geographical location (rounded coordinates)
- Creates location clusters to minimize travel distance
- Considers delivery zones and districts

### 2. Priority-Based Sequencing

```typescript
const priorityWeights = {
  URGENT: 4,
  HIGH: 3,
  NORMAL: 2,
  LOW: 1,
};

// Orders are sorted by: Priority Weight ‚Üí Distance ‚Üí Pickup Date
```

### 3. Nearest Neighbor Optimization

- Starts from vehicle's current location or depot
- Selects nearest unvisited destination
- Minimizes total route distance
- Considers vehicle capacity constraints

### 4. Mixed Route Handling

- Prioritizes pickup orders first
- Sequences delivery orders after pickups
- Optimizes stop order within each category

## Real-Time Features
