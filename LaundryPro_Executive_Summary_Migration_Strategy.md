## Technical Risk Assessment

### **High-Risk Areas (Immediate Attention Required)**

1. **KVKV Compliance Gap** - Legal liability without Turkish GDPR compliance
2. **Security Vulnerabilities** - Current JWT storage method creates XSS risks
3. **Single Point of Failure** - No database replication or backup strategy
4. **Integration Dependencies** - GIB e-invoice integration critical for B2B market

### **Medium-Risk Areas (6-Month Timeline)**

1. **Performance Bottlenecks** - Current system won't handle 50+ concurrent businesses
2. **Scalability Constraints** - Database queries not optimized for multi-tenant scale
3. **Mobile Experience** - No PWA implementation limits mobile adoption

### **Low-Risk Areas (12+ Month Timeline)**

1. **AI/ML Features** - Nice-to-have but not market critical
2. **Advanced Analytics** - Can be implemented post-market validation
3. **IoT Integration** - Future enhancement opportunity
